# 🧭 Pathfinding Visualizer

A modular, interactive pathfinding visualizer built with **p5.js** and **JavaScript modules**. It supports algorithms like **A\*** and **Dijkstra**, letting users design a grid, place start/end points, and watch the algorithm find the shortest path in real time.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎨 Interactive grid editor (walls, start, end)
- ⚡ A* and Dijkstra's algorithm with animation
- ⏱ Adjustable animation speed
- ♻️ Reset and clear controls
- 🧩 Modular structure (grid, nodes, algorithms, heap)

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **JavaScript (ES Modules)**
- **p5.js** for rendering
- Custom **Binary Heap** for efficient priority queues

## 🖱 How to Use

1. **Start local server** (to avoid CORS issues):

   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
